Assignment Name: Final Project CMP244 Spring 2022 - Isshin-Ryu Archive History page
Description:  This website, in fulfillment of the Final Project requirements for CMP244-26583 Web Design II (County College of Morris, Spring 2022), is intended to supplement material found at the website of a local martial-arts school located in Northwest New Jersey. I have the pleasure of knowing the owners, who teach a particular style of karate called Isshin-Ryu, which was originated by Tatsuo Shimabuku in the years following World War II on his native island of Okinawa. I intend to provide further information about Shimabukuâ€™s life and philosophy of martial arts.  Additionally, I have incorporated many of the techniques that were learned in this class, as taught by Professor Michael Sidaras-Tiritto.  The user will encounter creative and proper (it is hoped) use of styling, JavaScript, animations, and the like.

                <P>Tatso Shimabuku came to America in 1964 and 1966.  His demonstrations were legendary, particularly the Cleveland conference of 1966. His students included Don Nagle, Howard Long, and Steve Armstrong, among others. These disciples went on to open their own dojos throughout the land, and taught countless students the "One-Hearted Way." </P><BR/>
                <P>Shimabuku died in 1975. His disciples carried Isshin-Ryu to subsequent generations, most notably in America, where it exploded in popularity. Masters and acolytes of Isshin-Ryu regularly make pilgrimages to Kinaka, Gushikawa, Okinawa, where Tatsuo is buried. </P><BR/>
