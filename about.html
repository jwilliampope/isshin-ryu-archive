Assignment Name: Final Project CMP244 Spring 2022 - Isshin-Ryu Archive About page
Description:  This website, in fulfillment of the Final Project requirements for CMP244-26583 Web Design II (County College of Morris, Spring 2022), is intended to supplement material found at the website of a local martial-arts school located in Northwest New Jersey. I have the pleasure of knowing the owners, who teach a particular style of karate called Isshin-Ryu, which was originated by Tatsuo Shimabuku in the years following World War II on his native island of Okinawa. I intend to provide further information about Shimabukuâ€™s life and philosophy of martial arts.  Additionally, I have incorporated many of the techniques that were learned in this class, as taught by Professor Michael Sidaras-Tiritto.  The user will encounter creative and proper (it is hoped) use of styling, JavaScript, animations, and the like.
